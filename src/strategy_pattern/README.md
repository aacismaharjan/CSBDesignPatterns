The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them in separate classes, and make them interchangeable at runtime. This pattern is useful when you want to dynamically select an algorithm based on different conditions without modifying the client code.

---

## **Key Concepts**
1. **Context**: The class that uses a strategy object.
2. **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface for all concrete strategies.
3. **Concrete Strategies**: Different implementations of the strategy interface.

---

## **When to Use the Strategy Pattern**
- When multiple algorithms exist for a particular task, and you want to switch between them dynamically.
- When you want to eliminate conditional statements (e.g., `if-else` or `switch` statements) that determine which algorithm to use.
- When a class has multiple behaviors that can vary independently.

---


## **Benefits of the Strategy Pattern**
✅ **Open/Closed Principle**: You can add new strategies without modifying existing code.  
✅ **Eliminates Conditionals**: Avoids multiple `if-else` or `switch` statements.  
✅ **Encapsulation of Algorithms**: Each strategy is isolated, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.  
✅ **Runtime Flexibility**: The algorithm can be changed at runtime.

This pattern is widely used in frameworks like **Spring** (e.g., selecting different authentication providers), **game AI** (choosing different enemy behaviors), and **data processing** (using different sorting or filtering strategies).

## **Examples**
## Load Balancing Strategy in Microservices (Spring Boot)

```java
public class LoadBalancerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoadBalancerContext context = new LoadBalancerContext();

        // Use Random Load Balancer
        context.setStrategy(new RandomLoadBalancer());
        System.out.println("Random Load Balancer chose: " + context.getServer());

        // Switch to Round-Robin Load Balancer
        context.setStrategy(new RoundRobinLoadBalancer());
        System.out.println("Round-Robin Load Balancer chose: " + context.getServer());
    }
}

```
### Use Case in Cloud & Microservices
- AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and NGINX use similar strategies.
- Improves high availability in Spring Boot microservices.
- Used in containerized applications (Docker, Kubernetes).


## Machine Learning Model Selection in AI Application
```java
public class StrategyPatternAIExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PredictionContext context = new PredictionContext();

        // Use Neural Network Strategy
        context.setPredictionStrategy(new NeuralNetworkPrediction());
        System.out.println(context.predict("Image Classification"));

        // Switch to Decision Tree Strategy
        context.setPredictionStrategy(new DecisionTreePrediction());
        System.out.println(context.predict("Fraud Detection"));
    }
}

```

### Use Case in AI & Data Science
- Switching between machine learning models based on accuracy and performance.
- Used in AI-driven recommendations (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).
- Applied in fraud detection systems for financial transactions.
